	<p class='presentation'>Hello! My name is Tarn Ellis and Iâ€™m a freelance illustrator and designer based in Bristol, UK. 
	I create prints as well as single edition pieces, custom illustrations, magazine covers and logo designs. 
	I have also worked alongside authors to illustrate poetry and self love books.</p>
	
	<p class='presentation'>With each piece I create, I hope to take the viewer on a journey of transformation, peace and self love. 
	I believe art is deeply healing, and my hope is that the meditative state in which I 
	create is translated to you as you view it.</p>
	
	<p class='presentation'>I am inspired by women, Mother Nature, different cultures and self care. 
	I encorporate beautiful Moroccan scenes, Indian patterns and African colours into my illustrations. 
	Diversity is important to me, and so I represent women of different cultures and backgrounds through my work.</p>
	
	<p class='presentation'>My style depicts faceless women. 
	As humans, we are complex, multifaceted, and cannot be defined by any one label. 
	We are ever evolving and may be different one day to the next. 
	Therefore, through this method, we may resonate and find ourselves in many of the women in my artworks. 
	Overall, I wanted my artwork to be a celebration of all it means to be alive - strength, peace, compassion, and femininity.</p>
	
	<p class='presentation'>My own spirituality and background in psychology has led me to this place of creation, 
	and has enabled me to share with you my thoughts and experiences in the form of art. 
	I am eternally grateful that I am able to do this as a career, and am very lucky to have such a supportive and loving following.</p>
